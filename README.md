🌳 Tree Classification using Machine Learning
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on classifying different types of trees based on various features. It is built using Python and Jupyter Notebook as part of a learning module (EDUNET_Week_1.ipynb). The project walks through all key ML steps: loading data, exploring it, preprocessing it, training models, and evaluating the results.

📖 Overview
Tree classification is an essential task in environmental sciences, agriculture, and forestry, helping automate the identification of tree species based on measurable features. In this notebook, we implement a classification pipeline using machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest to predict the class of tree species from input features.

🧪 Project Workflow
The project follows these main steps:

1. Data Loading
Import tree-related dataset using pandas.

Preview basic information and statistics.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Check for missing values, data types, and class distribution.

Visualize features using bar plots and pairplots.

3. Preprocessing
Convert categorical data to numeric using encoding.

Normalize or scale values if required.

Split data into training and test sets.

4. Model Building
Train a Decision Tree Classifier.

Train a Random Forest Classifier for comparison.

5. Model Evaluation
Use accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

Visualize the decision tree (optional, using graphviz or plot_tree).

🚀 Getting Started
